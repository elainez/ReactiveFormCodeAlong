  we need to listen to the host element's input event so that we can update the FormControls value whenever the user types anything into the input element. 
  We can do that with a special Angular decorator named HostListener, and we just import that from Angular core. 
  @HostListener lets you listen to DOM events on the host element (the element the directive is attached to).
'input' is a DOM event triggered whenever the value of an input element changes (like typing into a text box).

  And the first parameter that we passed into the HostListener decorator is the event that we want to listen to, so we'll pass in the input event. 
  And this decorator decorates a function that should be called when the input event fires.
